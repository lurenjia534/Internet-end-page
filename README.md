# Welcome to the page where the Internet ends 👏
## Congratulations! ❤

You have finally reached the end of the internet!
There's nothing more to see, no more links to visit.
You've done it all.
This is the very last page on the very last server at the very far end of the internet.

You should now turn off your computer and go do something useful with the rest of your life. *

Suggestions:

- Read a book
- Do some public service
- Personally interact with your neighbors that you've probably only met online
- Plant a tree
- Introduce yourself to those other people who live at your house (your family).

* Please don't forget to turn off the lights on your way out.😆

life is short, make the most of it... :) 

In order to save time, we will now start downloading the internet to your local drive.
